# Deploy the frontend on Render

Create a **Web Service** from this repository (not a Static Site), select branch **dev** and runtime **Docker**, and use `./Dockerfile` with build context `.`. Leave Docker Command empty. The image builds SvelteKit and runs its Node server on Render's `PORT`. You can also import this repository's `render.yaml`.

Set:

| Variable      | Value                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BACKEND_URL` | The backend's actual origin, e.g. `https://YOUR-BACKEND.onrender.com`; do not append `/api/v1`. |
| `NODE_ENV`    | `production` (also set in the image).                                                           |

Health check: `/health`.

On the backend, set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a JSON array containing this frontend's exact HTTPS URL with no trailing slash, and `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.

The browser talks to `/api/v1` on the frontend's own domain. The Svelte server forwards those requests to `BACKEND_URL` and returns session cookies unchanged. This keeps login/CSRF handling on one browser origin. Database credentials belong only to the backend.

The sign-in screen is available at `/login`; successful sign-in opens the dashboard at `/`. The application supports the fourteen reusable screens, including requisition, approval, Board, audit and account-security journeys. Configure email and private storage on the backend. Create a configuration operator using its one-time provisioning command; there are no default credentials. See [local development and onboarding](development.md) for the full setup.

## Local container

```sh
docker build -t custodian-ui .
docker run --rm -p 3000:10000 -e BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-BACKEND.onrender.com custodian-ui
```

For a complete local HTTP setup, set the backend's allowed origin to `http://localhost:3000`, use `COOKIE_SECURE=false` only locally, and provide a backend address reachable from the UI container.

Both build and runtime stages use Node 24. The final image runs as the non-root node user, contains the built application and production dependencies, and excludes local environment files.

## Account access

Deploy the matching backend and let its startup script apply all migrations through the current head (`0020`). The backend uses one `DATABASE_URL` for migrations and the running application; `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is no longer needed. Development and production each use a different database and backend connection. To send account links, configure backend `MAIL_FROM`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_LINK_SECRET` and `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, then set `MAIL_ENABLED=true`. See the backend deployment guide for sender verification and secret requirements. No email secrets belong on this frontend service.

Set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` to this frontend's exact HTTPS origin and include it in backend `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. With email disabled, the form reports unavailable delivery. Links use a fragment, which the page removes from visible/history state before validation. Passwords and tokens stay out of browser storage. Reset signs out existing sessions; activation grants no automatic authority. The invitation dialog is available on Staff & Access (`/staff`) for users with staff:manage. Create companies and departments on Organisation & Authority (`/organisation`), then assign approved staff memberships and offices on Staff & Access. Both screens require their specific administrative capabilities. No new environment variables or schema migration are needed for screen 12.

Render uses HTTPS. The browser test harness explicitly supplies a trusted loopback proxy protocol header for its local HTTP Node server; do not copy that test-only header configuration into an untrusted public proxy setup.

## Private requisition documents

The image sets `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT=11M` for supporting-document uploads. Remove an older 2M Render override or set it to 11M. Cloudinary credentials belong only on the backend; see its `docs/render.md`. The frontend uses authenticated application upload/download APIs and receives no Cloudinary credentials or delivery URLs. PDF/PNG/JPEG files default to 5 MB each. Malware scanning is deferred by owner decision.

## Individual approval release

Deploy the backend through schema 0012 before this frontend. The existing startup script runs that migration automatically. No new environment variables are required. My Tasks opens the assigned individual approval inbox; returned requests use Start correction and the existing requisition form. Earlier signed revisions and documents remain available through Request history. The Board workspace and requisition notifications are delivered by the subsequent matching releases; the current backend migration head is `0020`.

## Notification drawer release

Deploy the matching backend through migration `0015` before this frontend. The existing Dockerfile includes the header drawer. There are no new frontend settings; notification email uses the backend's existing Resend configuration. The drawer remains usable when email is disabled, and provider acceptance is labelled separately from actual inbox delivery. Verify a request/approver handoff after deployment using your own accounts.
